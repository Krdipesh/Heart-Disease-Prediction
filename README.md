# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The project encompassed several key phases, including data collection and preprocessing, model architecture design, and rigorous evaluation. Extensive data cleaning and preprocessing procedures were undertaken to ensure data quality. An ANN architecture was constructed, consisting of multiple layers with specified neurons, activation functions, and optimization techniques. Training, validation, and test datasets were carefully partitioned to assess model performance.
